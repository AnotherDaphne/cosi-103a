Finally, you can run:

# Tasty Recipes Website

There is a main landing page that includes a navigation bar of 7 different recipes\
with an image, a short summary, and a button that takes you to the detail page for each recipe.

In each detail page includes an image of the dish, a list of ingedients, and step-by-step\
instructions to how to create the dish. The bottom of the page will have a "backtoHome" button.
