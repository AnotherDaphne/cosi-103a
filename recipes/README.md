# How to Run the Recipes React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To run the website, complete the following:

### `cd recipes`
This changes the directory to the recipes folder. Next, run:

### `npm install`
This installs node_modules and packages to run the pages.

Finally, you can run:
### `npm start ` 
This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
